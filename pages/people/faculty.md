  <p style="font-size: 30px; margin-bottom: 5px;"><strong>Biography</strong></p>
  I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.pusan.ac.kr/cse/index.do) and the [College of BioMedical Convergence Engineering](https://bce.pusan.ac.kr/bce/index.do) at [Pusan National University](https://www.pusan.ac.kr/kor/Main.do). Before joining PNU, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar at UC Berkeley in the EECS Department. I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Yonsei University in 2022 under the guidance of Prof. Kwanghoon Sohn. I received my B.S. in the same department from Yonsei University in 2016. Additionally, I have worked as a research intern at Adobe and have been actively involved in various research collaborations.
