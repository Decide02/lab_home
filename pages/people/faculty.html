## Biography

I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://cse.pusan.ac.kr/cse/index.do" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a> and the <a href="https://bce.pusan.ac.kr/bce/index.do" target="_blank" rel="noopener">College of BioMedical Convergence Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.pusan.ac.kr/kor/Main.do" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pusan National University</a>. Before joining PNU, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar at UC Berkeley in the EECS Department. I obtained my Ph.D. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Yonsei University in 2022 under the guidance of Prof. Kwanghoon Sohn. I received my B.S. in the same department from Yonsei University in 2016. Additionally, I have worked as a research intern at Adobe and have been actively involved in various research collaborations.
